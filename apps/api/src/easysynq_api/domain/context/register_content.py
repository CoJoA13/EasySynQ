``build_register`` produces the canonical dict that is BOTH the register version's WORM source blob
(``rfc8785.dumps`` — JCS) AND the ``metadata_snapshot.context_register`` fold, so the bytes and the
snapshot can never diverge (the S-rec-3 invariant; the ``domain/risk/register_content`` sibling).

Unlike the risk register, clause 4.1 has **no computed/graded axis**
(``classification``/``category``/
``status`` are categorical user inputs, not a derived band), so there is **no ``criteria`` block and
no ``resolve_criteria``** — the frozen content is purely the rows. The live satellite rows are read
back as-is.
