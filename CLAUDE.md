# EasySynQ — Project Context

> Read this first. It orients a new session. The **authoritative** detail lives in `docs/` —
> start with `docs/00-overview.md` (front door) and `docs/decisions-register.md` (the binding decisions).

## What this is

EasySynQ is a **self-hosted, browser-based ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System (QMS)**. Its
core idea is to *invert authority* so document drift becomes an **enforced invariant** rather than a
discipline problem: a managed **controlled vault** (PostgreSQL + MinIO WORM) owns the master copy of
every controlled document and record, and the on-disk filesystem is only a **read-only, organized
mirror** regenerated from Released versions. It is built to prevent document drift, track revision
changes, manage documented evidence/records, and keep an organization audit-ready by default. The
UI/UX flows the way ISO 9001 flows (clause spine / process map / PDCA) and must stay calm, modern,
and progressively disclosed — never overwhelming.

## Current status (as of 2026-05-31)

**Spec-only — there is NO application code yet, and that is intentional.** The owner wants the design
right before any code is written. What exists:

- A complete, internally-reconciled **specification** in `docs/` (00–17 + `decisions-register.md`).
  It was authored by fan-out, adversarially audited (`docs/17`), then a **reconciliation/hardening
  pass** back-propagated the Decisions Register into every section (37/41 audit findings resolved +
  4 cleanup edits; residual items are documented, non-blocking, and deferred to v1.x/Future).
- A self-contained, clickable **HTML UI mockup** at `mockup/easysynq-mockup.html` (open in a browser;
  no build/deps). 8 navigable screens, light/dark toggle. The owner has reviewed it and is happy.

**Likely next step (not started):** turn the `docs/16-roadmap.md` MVP into a concrete implementation
plan, then build a first vertical slice. Hold at the planning level until the owner approves.

## The four LOCKED foundational decisions (never contradict)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| **D1** | **Self-hosted web app.** On the org's own server; browser access; data never leaves their infra; admin-controlled backups; single-organization per install; no phone-home. |
| **D2** | **Managed controlled vault** is the source of truth (PostgreSQL + object storage). Filesystem = read-only mirror, regenerated from Released versions only. Authority flows vault → mirror, never the reverse. |
| **D3** | **ISO 9001:2015 foundation**, *architected* (not built) to extend cleanly to 21 CFR Part 11 e-signatures and multi-standard frameworks (ISO 13485/14001/45001/IATF). Reserved hooks exist (`signature_event`, `framework_id`, M:N clause mapping) — do not implement them in v1, do not remove them. |
| **D4** | **Stack:** React/TS + Mantine + Tailwind (SPA) · FastAPI / Python 3.12 (API) · PostgreSQL 16 + MinIO + OpenSearch + Redis · Celery workers · Keycloak (auth) · Gotenberg/LibreOffice (rendering) · Caddy (TLS) · Docker Compose (single host; S/M/L profiles). |

**Permission philosophy (locked):** hybrid **RBAC + ABAC** — granular `domain.action` permissions,
bundled into org-defined roles, scopable to system/process/folder/document, with per-user overrides
and explicit deny. **Deny-by-default; deny-always-wins.** ADMIN sits *outside* the QMS with full
system permissions. Per a stakeholder decision, the **Quality Manager may hold `permission.grant`
scoped to content domains within QMS scope**; system permissions (user/storage/backup/restore/config/
import) stay admin-only.

## Other stakeholder decisions made this session

- **Import default = current-version-only** (older copies archived as provenance); revision-chain
  reconstruction is opt-in per family; Document-vs-Record *kind* is always human-confirmed.
- **Tamper-evidence requires a mandatory off-host / append-only audit-checkpoint anchor.**
- The full reconcile+harden pass was completed (see `docs/decisions-register.md`).

## Document map (`docs/`)

`decisions-register.md` is **AUTHORITATIVE** — it resolves R1–R37 and **supersedes any conflicting
text** in the section docs. If two docs disagree, the Register wins; otherwise the more specific
section governs (00 §7 explains authority precedence).

- `00-overview.md` — front door: summary, locked decisions, TOC, cross-cutting map, persona×feature matrix
- `01` vision/personas/glossary · `02` ISO domain model & information architecture · `03` architecture & stack
- `04` document control & vault · `05` revision & drift · `06` records & evidence · `07` authorization model
- `08` setup & onboarding · `09` ingestion engine · `10` workflows & notifications · `11` UI/UX design system
- `12` security & audit · `13` search & reporting · **`14` data model (ERD)** · **`15` API design**
- `16` roadmap (MVP → v1 → v1.x → Future) · `17` gaps & open-questions (with per-finding resolution status)

## Conventions used throughout the spec

- **Document lifecycle = 7 canonical states:** `Draft → InReview → Approved → Effective →
  UnderRevision → Superseded → Obsolete` (the 5-state form is a simplified UI view).
- Permission keys are `domain.action` (canonical catalog in `docs/07`; data-model seed in `docs/14 §3.1`).
- 8 canonical personas: Avery (Admin), Mara (Quality Manager), Diego (Process Owner), Priya (Author),
  Ken (Approver), Ingrid (Internal Auditor), Sam (Employee), Olsen (External Auditor).
- `signature_event.meaning` enum (v1): `review, approval, release, obsolete, verify, disposition,
  import_baseline, review_confirmed`; `authored`/`responsibility` reserved for the Part-11 phase.

## Working preferences

- **Spec/plan before code.** Produce and get approval on a plan before implementing.
- The owner used **`/effort ultracode`** (multi-agent Workflow orchestration) for the heavy
  spec/mockup work; `/effort` is per-session, so re-enable it if you want that approach again.
- When a genuinely strategic decision is the owner's to make, ask rather than silently pick.
- Persistent memory: `~/.claude/projects/-home-cojoa13-Documents-EasySynQ/memory/` (MEMORY.md index).

## How to view the mockup

`mockup/easysynq-mockup.html` — open in a browser (e.g. `xdg-open mockup/easysynq-mockup.html`).
This laptop has **no headless browser**, so PNG screenshots can't be auto-generated here; install one
(e.g. `chromium-browser`) if static images are wanted.
