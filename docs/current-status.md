# Current execution snapshot

This is the dated coordination snapshot for contributors and repository automation. It is not product
authority and it is not runtime discovery: binding decisions live in
[`decisions-register.md`](decisions-register.md), while current deferred work lives only in
[`open-residuals.md`](open-residuals.md).

## Shipped boundary

The original MVP foundation and the ISO 9001 workflow families are delivered. The routed SPA covers the
main document, workflow, compliance, reporting, audit, ingestion, drift, objective, management-review,
DCR, improvement, risk, context, interested-party, and identity-provisioning surfaces. Records,
retention/disposition, and Evidence Packs are API/worker-complete but do not have dedicated SPA
management routes.

The last shipped slice binds every non-deduplicated staging promotion to one opaque, version-bound source
identity across browser check-in, Record capture/correction, generated content, and import workers.
Detailed shipped behavior, mutations, and evidence remain in
[`slice-history.md`](slice-history.md#s-upload-identity--exact-staged-source-identity-through-worm-promotion).

## Runtime truth

Before creating a migration, run:

```bash
cd apps/api && uv run alembic heads
```

The frontmatter value above is a dated snapshot. `alembic heads` is the migration authority; do not infer
the head from filename sorting or prose.

The permission catalog is defined in [`07-authorization-model.md`](07-authorization-model.md) and
enforced by the executable catalog assertion in `apps/api/tests/unit/test_authz.py`. The complete decision
set is defined by the headings and self-range declarations in [`decisions-register.md`](decisions-register.md).

## Verification baseline

The numeric frontmatter records the fresh completion gates for the last shipped slice. It is consumed by
repository automation and must remain parseable, unique-keyed, and comma-free. A later slice updates it
only after fresh evidence; partial or unavailable checks must be reported as such.

## CI topology

The frontmatter records the current workflow topology snapshot. The workflow files themselves are
executable truth. Contributor workflow and evidence expectations live in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)
and [`dev-workflow.md`](dev-workflow.md).

The dependency-light `contracts` job runs repository-authority and R61 protection first, then the Fedora
bootstrap/doctor/proof structural contracts and the disabled PostgreSQL MCP contract before dependency
hydration. These checks prove tracked interfaces and failure propagation; they do not emulate Fedora,
SELinux, libvirt, Docker, or a live application stack.

## Programme 0 acceptance status

- PostgreSQL MCP: **disabled** after the reviewed package failed the high-severity advisory gate. No
  connector, launcher, package lock, owner-database port overlay, or orphan database role ships. The sole
  re-enablement contract is [`RES-POSTGRES-MCP-REPLACEMENT`](open-residuals.md#res-postgres-mcp-replacement).
- Disposable Fedora Workstation proof: **PENDING — not run on this checkout as of 2026-08-08**. No Fedora
  media checksum, evidence commit, or PASS result is recorded because the required Fedora 44 Everything
  netinstall and Workstation Live media plus a usable `qemu:///system` proof host were not available.
  Completion requires the manual PR/release gate in [`runbooks/fedora-proof.md`](runbooks/fedora-proof.md).
- Local focused Python acceptance: **PASS on 2026-08-08 with CPython 3.12.13**. The Programme 0
  dependency-tooling, deployment-configuration, and CI-workflow matrix completed 80 tests. This does not
  replace the full repository suites or the pending Fedora VM proof.
